# PIC-DEVELOPMENT-BOARD
PIC-DVK LGSL16-300_V1.0
## INTRODUCTION.
Logsunâ€™s PIC-DVK LGSL16-300_V1.0 supports 40 pin PIC microcontroller. LGS-PIC-U can be used extensively to test and validate programs. At the heart of the development board is PIC 18F4520 controller, this provided advance feature like ISP, SPI, on chip ADC etc.The microcontroller has 8K x 14 words of Internal flash memory and 368 bytes on chip SRAM. LGS- PIC board and related software routines help the system designers to rapidly design and prototype their designs based in PIC Core.
